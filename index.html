            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We met in February 2024, on an online platform called Boo. What started as simple conversations quickly turned into deep exchanges, as we asked each other countless questions to understand who we were and what made us tick. During those late-night chats, I found myself teaching her about astronomy and sharing little bits of knowledge, and she soaked it all in with a curious mind and an open heart. Over time, we discovered something special ‚Äì a connection that blossomed into something more.

We fell in love, and for a while, everything felt perfect. But life, with its challenges, insecurities, and family issues, caused a rift between us. Even though we separated, the love never faded. We knew deep down that what we had was real and worth fighting for. So, we decided to rebuild, to start fresh, and this time with the courage to face whatever came our way. Our first meeting in person was a dream come true, a moment of joy and happiness that confirmed we were meant to be.

Now, here we are, stronger than ever, happy in each other's arms, and determined to stay that way. Our journey together is just beginning, and I know that no matter what life brings, we'll face it side by side. Together, forever. 
                This website is a small way of showing how much you mean to me Sneha.

                I dream of a future where we grow together, not just in love but in every way possible. We‚Äôll build a life full of success, joy, and endless adventures. I want us to travel the world, exploring new places, experiencing new cultures, and creating memories that will last a lifetime. Through it all, we‚Äôll always be there for each other, supporting one another through every challenge and celebrating every triumph. We‚Äôll share the kind of playful, naughty moments that bring us even closer, creating a bond that‚Äôs truly unbreakable.

I see us getting married, starting our own little family, and raising kids who will know the love we‚Äôve always shared. Our home will be full of warmth, laughter, and the simple joy of being together. I want us to stay happy, not just physically, but mentally, always lifting each other up and ensuring we thrive in every way. We‚Äôll grow old together, and when the time comes, I want nothing more than to pass on from this world with you by my side, holding my hand, just like we‚Äôve always done‚Äîforever, and always.
